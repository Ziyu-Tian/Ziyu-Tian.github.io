## 1: Basic Concepts 

### 1.1: Passive sign convention
- Passive sign convention is the convention we commonly used, which is satisfied when the current enters through the *positive terminal (+)*of an element. For the voltage analysis (eg. mesh analysis), if we follow a vested direction (mostly clockwise) of a loop, if the direction arrow enter the *positive terminal (+)* of a element, that voltage will be marked as *'+'* and vice versa.
- For example, the 5 V source in the Loop 1 should be marked as '-' as the following image.

### 1.2: Type of the Sources 
- **Ideal Independent sources** is an active elements(could generate power) that provides a specified voltage or current is *completely independent* of other elements. We use the 'circled sources' refer to **independent sources**.

- **Ideal dependent (controlled) source** is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current. There are four types of dependent sources, namely:  VCVS (voltage-controlled voltage source), CCVS, VCCS, CCCS. We use the 'diamond-shaped symbols' refer to **dependent source**.
