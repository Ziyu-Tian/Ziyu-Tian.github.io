# Computer Systems and Microprocessors 


## I: Background

### 1: Fundamentals of CMOS 

#### 1.1: Transistor fundamentals: NMOS 

* NMOS, i.e. Negative Metal Oxide Field Efficient Transistor.

![](image/2022-10-04-10-03-42.png)

* The drain / source area are both doping with electrons (n-type doping), while the substrate is doped with holes.

* The insulator is filled with oxide.

* The gate is a switch which controlled by the $V_{GS}$ (voltage between gate and source). The high potential voltage will attracts the minor electrons in substrate so that form the channel.

* The electrons will move from the source to the drain and inverse for the current.

* The symbol of NMOS is below (sometimes using 'inlet' arrow ):

#### 1.2: Transistor fundamentals: PMOS 

* The same mechanism as NMOS.

![](image/2022-10-04-10-15-41.png)

* Note that the positive voltage for gate for NMOS is ON, the negative voltage for PMOS is ON.

 * 2 transistors needed.

### 3: CMOS Logic Circuits: NAND 


![](image/2022-10-04-10-54-58.png)

- If we fix one input as '1', this can also be used as an inverter. 


### 4: CMOS Logic Circuits: NOR 


![](image/2022-10-04-10-58-27.png)

- If we fix one of the input as '0', this can be used as an inverter.

### 5: D-type flip-flop (Latches)


![](image/2022-10-04-10-59-09.png)

- '0' for reset and '1' for set when clock is '1'.

## II: Computer Systems 

### 1: Modern Computing Systems 

* High Performance Computing 

* General Purpose Computing

* Embedded Computing 

* Ubiquitous Computing 

### 2: Computer Architecture 

![](image/2022-10-04-11-34-40.png)

* Core to the computation is the processors and memory organization.

* IO devices allow various user-interfaced.

* Modulation keeps the things simple.


- Key components of a Microprocessor:
    - Memories 
    - Busses / Interconnects
    - Processors (CPU,etc.)
    - IOs and controllers.

### 3: Memory 

* Provides the temporary or permanent storage needed by the processors/ IOs.

#### 3.1: Type of Memory 

- A. Register:
    - Small and fast; consists of a number of flip-flops
    - Flashed out when powered off.
- B. Cache Memory:
    - Large but slower memories, usually Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs)
    - Flashed out when powered off.
- C. Main Memory:
    - Even larger and slower.
    - Usually Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAMs)
- D. Secondary Storage:
    - Larger and even slower.
    - Usually disk drives.
- E. Other Memories: Offline/Flash Memories
    - Used to store offline information.


#### 3.2: Memory Trade-offs 

![](image/2022-10-04-11-45-57.png)

#### 3.3: Memory Hierarchy 

- The memory elements close to CPU are generally the fastest and costliest.

![](image/2022-10-04-11-58-04.png)


#### 3.4: Register 

- A register is a parallel set of N flip-flops, with all clock lines connected with the CPU clock.

- Size N is equal to the CPU word length. In 32-bits CPU, you can find 32-bits registers.


![](image/2022-10-04-12-01-46.png)


- Registers can be different types:
    - *Accumulators*: register that directly stories/retrieves from memory.
    - *General purpose*: store data during execution.
    - *Special purpose*: used by the computer systems instead of the user:

- Different architectures have different number of registers depend on the **Instruction Set Architecture**.

#### 3.5: Cache Memory 

- Cache memories are usually static random memory (SRAM) (6 transistors)

![](image/2022-10-10-07-48-17.png)

- SRAMs have three operations:
    - Hold (WL = 0), Write and Read (WL = 1)
- BL: bit line feeds data into the cell.
- WL: word select line

- BL/WL basically feed two inverters.

- Back to back inverters in the red circles.

- M4 and M5 are access transistors as switches.

#### 3.6: Cache Memory: SRAM basics

![](image/2022-10-10-07-52-28.png)

- Hold
    - WL=Low, M5 and M6 (access transistors) are OFF.
    - data held in latch.(back to back inverter)
- Write: (BL = High and WL = High, write 1)
    - M5 and M6 are switched on.
    - M6 allows the current through (High) and feeds the inverter $I_2$.
    - $I_2$ generates Low output; then the output is fed back to $I_1$; $I_1$ generate High output.
    - The high and low loop between the inverters remember the logic ($I_1$ output).

- Read: (WL = High select the word line)
    - M5 and M6 are switched on.
    - If $I_1$ is high - M4 is on, causes current ($V_{dd}$) to flow through M4 to the BL.
    - The current and its direction is read by a current sense amp (detect logic high).

#### 3.7: Cache Memory Operation 


- Cache exploits the **principle of locality**: programs tends to execute the same small set of instructions and data repeatedly.

- When the processor needs data for execution, first checks the cache:
    - If the data in the cache, it is called a HIT.
    - If else, it is called a MISS.


![](image/2022-10-10-09-14-30.png)

- Size and Performance trade-offs:
    - Larger cache may increase HIT ratio, but the overall access time may increase.
    - Smaller cache may increase MISS ratio, which may affect the performance.

- The first write is slow and the following writes are faster as you just need to write or update cache.
- The speed-up factor using cache is almost 10.
- When the cache becomes full, 'old' entries can be overwritten by randomly chosen.
- When cache entries are more updated than main memory, the entries marked as **dirty entries**.
    - Dirty lines are updated in the main memory soon.
    - The process of ensuring integrity of data is called **cache coherence**.


#### 3.8: Cache Size Tradeoff 

- The word 'latency' means the latency time for the computer to read the data.
- Effective Latency = Hit ratio * Hit Latency + Miss Ratio * Miss Latency
(the average time required for memory access)
- If the caches missed in the L1 Cache, then it will come to L2 cache.

![](image/2022-10-11-11-16-00.png)

- Note if we treat the miss ratio is fixed in every level as p, then the hit ratio will be 1-p.

- 'Temporal locality' refers to the reuse of the data which are time relatively.
- 'Spatial locality' refers to use of the data within close storage locations. When am instruction or a data is repeated a number of time it manifests spatial locality.


![](image/2022-10-11-11-25-16.png)

- Caches contains several blocks.
- For the same caches size, larger block size lead to good temporal locality.

#### 3.9: Main Memory 

![](image/2022-10-11-11-34-11.png)

- Generally DRAMs:
    - Dynamic: refreshed needed (the electrons may discharge when time past)
    - Volatile: loses data when power is removed.
- Comparison to SRAMs:
    - Smaller but more expansive.
    - Not fast as SRAMs.(more refreshing circuitry)
- Main memory is the primary storage - all changes in registers and caches must be coherent with the mai memory.

- In theory, when the word line is '0', the electrons in the capacitor may keep. However the electrons may leap, if the original voltage is 1 V, the electrons will not be detected when V = 0.5. So we need a charging after the 0.5 point, which is the freshing.

##### 3.9.1: The DRAM basics

- Write:
  - BL = '1' and WL = '1':
  - Access transistor ON, C charge to Vdd (HI).
  - After refresh period, rewrite the data.
- Read:
  - WL = HI
  - Access transistor is ON, assume C has ~Vdd(HI) charge.
  - Bit line read the voltage across C.
- Hold:
  - C will retain the charge.
  - The leakage current cause the discharge.
  - Refresh needed.

##### 3.9.2: DRAM Read: Sense Amplifier 
![](image/2022-10-12-14-45-34.png)
![](image/2022-10-12-14-52-52.png)
- To read '1':
    - WL = '0', the up and down BL keep 0.5 V.
    - WL = '1', the BL connected with C (HI), the discharging begin.
    - In the side with BL, the voltage increased and other side decreased.
    - Then the signal '1' in BL side can be detected.
    - The voltage will soon charge the C again.
- To read '0':
    - WL = '0', the up and down keep 0.5 V.
    - WL = '1', the BL connected with C (LOW), the charging begin.
    - In the side with BL, the voltage decreased and other side decreased.
    - Then the signal '0' in BL side can be detected.
    - The voltage will soon discharge the C again.
- To write dada:
    - The double side pre-charged to 0.5 V.
    - Activate the WL, set BL to '0' or '1'.
    - Data wrote to cell.

![](image/2022-10-13-07-57-20.png)

##### 3.9.3: DRAM Array 

- Several memory cell consist the memory array.

![](image/2022-10-13-08-00-02.png)

#### 3.10: The Memory Wall

- Faster and parallel processor reducing CPI (clocks per Instruction).

- Complicated memory hierarchy is increasing the memory latency.

- The memory will limit the core efficiency.

![](image/2022-10-11-12-02-24.png)


#### 3.11: Other Memories: ROM 

- Read-only Memory
    - No capability for memory write.
    - Data programmed
    - Stable storage even when power is off
- Example: NOR-based ROM 
    - 8 bits words
    - Address selects active (HI) row 
    - The row selects lines program which line is HI, so teh data stored is fixed.

![](image/2022-10-13-08-32-57.png)


#### 3.12: Secondary Storage: Magnetic Disks

- Non-volatile memory, large and slower
- The disc is coated with magnetic materialã€‚
- Data is written serially in CW direction.
- Magnetise for '1', demagntise for '0'.

![](image/2022-10-13-09-17-02.png)
![](image/2022-10-13-10-00-57.png)

- The magnetic disks are consisted of:
    - Head: the head detector to read the magnetic direction.(hovering)
    - Track: the circle track drawn by head.
    - Cylinder: consist of different surface located in same radium circle, is a cylinder surface.
    - Sector: the different sector area divided by gap.
- Total disk capacity = sector size x sector per track x number of tracks per cylinder x number of cylinder.

- The sector is the actual data container:

![](image/2022-10-13-11-15-23.png)


#### 3.13: Off-line Storage: CD-ROM, DVD 

- Optical non-volatile, for long-term storage.
- Coated in metal with the area reflect light differently.
- Normal surface called the 'land'.
- Surface affects by laser is called the 'pit'.
- The pit and land can be read by weak laser beam.
- From inside to outside.
![](image/2022-10-13-11-19-47.png)


#### 3.14: Tertiary Storages: Flash memories 

- Non-volatile; can be electronically erased and reprogrammed.
    - Modern solid-state drives (SSD) for secondary storage.
    - Secure Digital (SD) Cards.
- Semiconductor non-volatile, non-rotary devices.
    - Faster than HDDs.
- Flash memories are made of storage cells:
    - Eg. Single-level cell (SLC)
    - Control Gate is the MOS gate.
    - Floating Gate electrically isolate the channel.
    - Higher threshold  voltage need to charge FG for write.
    - A voltage lower than threshold for reading.
    - For higher electron biasing hot electrons injection needed.
- ![](image/2022-10-13-11-26-51.png)

- Two charge states:
    - By default non charge in the float gate means '1'.
    - If the electrons injected to float gate, means '0'.

![](image/2022-10-13-12-22-22.png)

- Operations (NOR-based flash)
    - Reading:
        - For the '0', higher CG bias ($V_{T0}>5V$) required. (high voltage required to overcome the channel potential and the trapped charged impact)
        - For the '1', lower CG bias ($V_{T1}<V_{T0$) required.
    - Writing:
        - Need hot electrons injection (HEI)
        - HEI follow the quantum tunnelling.
        - Write '0': HEI applies HI (+ve) across the gate-source to allow FG to be charged negatively with low bit line.
        - Write '1': HEI applies HI (-ve) across gate-source to allow FG data to be erased with low bit line.
    - Hold:
        - The FG dictates the hold operation.
        - Negative charge for bit value = 0
        - No FG charge for bit value = 1
        - HEI causes oxide layer damage and this limit the lifetime of flash memories.
        - SLC have ~100k write cycles.

#### 3.15: NOR Multi-Level Cells

- Multi-level Cell (MLC)
    - Popular and high packing density
    - Multiple SLC in parallel give multiple logic levels.
    - MLC have typically ~10k cycles
- REading 
    - SImilar to the SLC, but with different biasing for different cells and configuration.

#### 3.16: Emerging Non-volatile Memories: Memristors

- Also called RRAM or register-RAM.
- T

- Two terminal element with variable doping:
    - The width and resistance of doped region varies with biasing.
    - When biasing makes w=D (device width) it is ON with $R_{ON}$
    - When biasing makes w=0 it is OFF with $R_{OFF}$.
    - The resistance cannot change without biasing.
- Resistive Memory: Meristor
- Current-Mode In-Memory Circuits: A *multiplier*

### 4: Interconnects

#### 4.1: Computer Interconnect

- Interconnect is a critical component in modern computer systems as it defines the underlying performance of the systems.
- Interconnects are used to connect various components in the system.

#### 4.2: The Importance of Interconnects

- Affects performance and energy efficiency
- Affect the scalability of a system.

#### 4.3: Managing Interconnects

- Driving an interconnect is hard for devices, which contain lots of buffers and wiring.

![](image/2022-10-22-15-42-44.png)

- Every system has an interconnect topology and protocol to manage how to:
    - **accessed**:(IO pin counts, and handshakes)
    - **shared**
    - **power managed**
- Different vendors like different bus architectures and protocols
    - ARM: AMBA 
    - Freescale: VME 
    - Intel: QuickPath

#### 4.4: Interconnect Skew

- All interconnects suffer from interconnect or bus **skew**, because the differences in wire length.
- Consider the following interconnect:

![](image/2022-10-22-16-09-51.png)

- Uneven wire lengths between send and receive nodes.
- Bound to cause skew between them.
- Designer need to design protocols addressing worst case skew times.
- Also affects the interconnect clock frequency.


#### 4.5: Interconnect Types

There are two fundamentally different bus protocols:

- Synchronous:
    - Includes a clock in the control lines.
    - A fixed protocol for communication relative to the clock.
    - Advantage: involves very little logic and can run fast.
    - Disadvantages: every device on the bus must run at the same clock rate to avoid clock skew, it cannot be very long.

- Asynchronous:
    - It is not clocked.
    - It can accommodate a wide range of device.
    - It can be lengthened without worrying about clock skew.
    - It requires a (rather complicated) handshaking protocol with overhands.


#### 4.6: Synchronous interconnects

- Having a clock line, which drives the interconnect transactions based on cycles.
- Interconnect cycles = several CPU cycles (typically 4-10)
- Example timing diagram: CPU reads data from device 
- Slanted line mean the possible change.

![](image/2022-10-23-09-30-11.png)

- At T0, the CPU sets the address lines and sets the mode bits to "read".
- The clock pulse width (T1-T0) must be long enough to:
    - accommodate propagation delay (skew)
    - allow the receiver to read the address 
- The receiver is ready to receive at T1. It sets the data lines.
- The data is read into the interconnect. At A2, the CPU reads the data.
- All lines are cleared for a new bus cycles at T3.

#### 4.7: Asynchronous interconnects

- Do not have a global/master clock, BUS cycles can have any length, depending upon the master/slave.

- Transfer is achieved by means of **handshaking**.

- Input (i.e.Read) operation:

![](image/2022-10-23-09-57-55.png)

- (T5-T0) is one interconnect cycle. At T0, the CPU sets the address and mode lines.

- The CPU allows until T1 for bus skew. It then sets the Ready signal. The addressed device receives the Ready signal shortly before T2. It sets the data line, and raises the Accept line to **acknowledge**  receipt.

- When the CPU sees the Accept, it allows for skew. At T3, it lowers Ready and read the data. After a bus skew delay, the CPU removes the address T4.

- At T5, the addressed device sees Ready going down. It lowers Accept and removes the data.

- The bus cycle is then finished.

- Output (Write) operation form CPU to device

![](image/2022-10-23-18-38-43.png)

- The CPU provides the data, so this is made immediately.

#### 4.8: Interconnect Topology 

- Topology: Specifies the way interconnect are wired.

- Different Topologies:
    - Shared bus:
        - Simplest, State-of-the-art 
        - Simpler arbitration protocols 
        - Scalability issues 
    - Point-to-point
        - ideal but high cost 
        - lots of wires 
        - Poor scalability
    - Cross bar or Network-on-chip 
        - emerging modular architectures
        - Packet switching based
    - Irregular interconnect 
        - Highly customized for given application 
        - not good scalability

#### 4.9:
