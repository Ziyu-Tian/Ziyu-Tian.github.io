## I: Logic Design Part-1

### 1: Introduction 

- Design based on **Boolean algebra** using combinatorial logics gates and sequential logic.

- Computer-aided design used and hence the inclusive of VHDL for hardware description.

#### 1.1: Building blocks

- Basic logic gates and their inverses:

#### 1.2: Logic Integration 

- Discrete elements:
    - Assemble gates from transistors, diodes, etc.

- SSI, MSI - integrated circuits. 

- LSI, VLSI (very large IC)
    - More gates on a chip 

- Design style progress:
    - Programmable, semicustom and custom.

#### 1.3: Digital logic Structure
