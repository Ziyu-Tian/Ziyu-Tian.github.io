# FM and FSK Lab Sheet 

## 1: The principle of FM 

$$
v_s(t) = V_c\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} J_n (\ beta) \cos{(2\pi (f_c\pm nf_m)t)}
$$

## 2: Frequency conversion factor 


- Measure the frequency when DC voltage is 0 V (almost 121.86K)

- Measure the frequency when DC voltage is 1 V (almost 116.36K)

Using formula 
$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta f_{out}}{\Delta V_{IN}}
$$

calculate the $\alpha$ (almost 5.5K).

## 3: Modulation index 

- Note that the $V_m$ from the oscilloscope should be halfed.

- Find the $V_m$ making carrier components disappeared (almost 714mV for Vpp)

- $\beta$ is about 1.9635 (first time)

- Check it with Bessel function 

## 4: Narrowband and Wideband FM

- One carrier and one pair of sidebands.

- Voltage less than 0.01V will not be significant.

- Find the max value of $V_m$ to get NBFM, calculate the modulation index.

- Measure the bandwidth.

- Same operation for WBFM.
