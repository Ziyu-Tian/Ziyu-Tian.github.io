## Abstract 

This experiment calculated the frequency conversion factor $\alpha$, generated and validated the frequency spectrum of narrow-band FM and wide-band FM with FM theory, verified the composition ratio of FM carrier power and total power in final result. Carried out the frequency shift keying demodulation with the plotted measurement graph of demodulated frequency response of slope detector and ratio detector, which satisfied the theoretical properties.

## Introduction

The Frequency Modulation 

## 2: Frequency conversion factor 


- Measure the frequency when DC voltage is 0 V (almost 121.86K)

- Measure the frequency when DC voltage is 1 V (almost 116.36K)

Using formula 
$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta f_{out}}{\Delta V_{IN}}
$$

calculate the $\alpha$ (almost 5.5K).

## 3: Modulation index 

- Note that the $V_m$ from the oscilloscope should be halfed.

- Find the $V_m$ making carrier components disappeared (almost 714mV for Vpp)

- $\beta$ is about 1.9635 (first time)

- Check it with Bessel function 

## 4: Narrowband and Wideband FM

- One carrier and one pair of sidebands.

- Voltage less than 0.01V will not be significant.

- Find the max value of $V_m$ to get NBFM, calculate the modulation index.

- Measure the bandwidth.

- Same operation for WBFM.
