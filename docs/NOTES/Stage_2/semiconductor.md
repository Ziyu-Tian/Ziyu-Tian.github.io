# Semiconductors Devices 

## I: Introduction 

### 1: Silicon Electronic Devices 

- Si is teh workhorse technology. (-99% of the market)
- Cheap.
- High Performance. 
- Challenges ahead,



### 2: Transistors-- the building block 

- 2 types:
    - Bipolar (NPN, PNP), 20% of the market 
    - MOSFET (CMOS), 80% of the market 
- Used for:
    - Analog - eg. Amplification 
    - Digital: ON or OFF
