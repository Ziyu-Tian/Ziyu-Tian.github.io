# VHDL Programming 

## I: Introduction 

- VHDL short for VLSI hardware description language.

- VHDL is not an executable language but represents the **elements of a digital circuit**.

### 1.1: Structural-level or gate-level 

The example of gate-level be like:

At this level the VHDL describes elements and how they connected to each other:

- 1: names and types for inputs and outputs.

- 2: logical elements types (AND, NOT, MUX)

- 3: names for internal signals (T1)

- 4: names for the instances of logical elements (U1)

- 5: connection between signals and ports

This representation is called the **netlist**.

### 1.2: Register Transfer Level (RTL) or data-flow level 

The RTL describes the transformation that data undergo while propagating through the circuit. The circuits can be seen as a set of two types of elements:

- 1: Combinatorial logic 

- 2: Registers 

## II: Design entitles 


Each system can be simplified to **modules or blocks**.

For example of roots calculation of second-degree equation:
