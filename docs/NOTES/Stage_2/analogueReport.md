## Abstract 

This experiment explored the properties of inverting operational amplifier (op-amp in short), which contain the plotted frequency response graphs, Gain-Bandwidth Product, slew rate and offset voltage, validated the mathematical operation of the summing op-amp and difference op-amp, discussed how the Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR in short) affect the efficiency of amplifier.

## Introduction 

The op-amp is a very high-gain (open-loop gain tending to infinity), DC-coupled differential voltage amplifier with very large (tending to infinity) input impedance and extremely low output impedance[1], which has six terminals: one non-inverting input is denoted by positive (+) sign, one inverting denoted by (−) sign, two where positive and negative power supplies (+VCC and −VCC or V+, & V−), as shown in Fig.1. As a active circuit element, op-amp is designed to perform mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration[2].

This experiment aimed at validating the bandwidth, cut-off frequency, slew rate, distortion phenomenon and the offset voltage of inverting op-amps, exploring the operation of the summing and difference op-amps with CMRR properties. To achieve the aims above, the tasks have been done as below:

- Calculate the total gain with the $V_{out}$ and $V_{in}$ in oscilloscope.

- Determine the bandwidth using the gain-bandwidth product provided in data sheet shown in Fig.2.

- Plot the frequency response and determine the cut-off frequency, then change another set of resistance repeat the test above.

- Increasing the frequency, observe the full power bandwidth then calculated the slew rate.

- Reconnect the circuit, determine the offset-voltage.

- Change the circuit to summing op-amp and difference op-amp, observing the operations and calculating the CMRR.
