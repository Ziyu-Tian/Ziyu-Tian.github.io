<font size=3 face=Times New Roman>

The rise of smartphones should be recalling to the end of 20th century, when the IBM Simon (shown in Fig.1) is invented by IBM and BellSouth in 1933. Powered by the inventing of MOSFET, IBM Simon with a touchscreen was referred as the first smartphone in the world. Based on the achievement of IBM Simon, the burgeoning smartphone industry developing rapidly. In 2008, Apple Company pushed out iPhone 3G, which is another milestone in the history of smartphone. As shown in Fig.2.1, iPhone 3G has already presented a complete exemplar electronic system, which is generally similar to the latest smartphone such as iPhone 15 shown in Fig.2.2. Since than, the smartphone become a typical system with multiple functional electronic devices, including MOSFETs inside the main processor and memory chip, CMOS image sensors in camera, p-n junction in MEMS sensors, Heterojunction Bipolar Transistorin (HBT) in radio frequency (RF) modules and LED in touchscreens. In the following report, I would focus on the the principles of these devices with related technology, demonstrate how these could be applied on modern smartphones.
