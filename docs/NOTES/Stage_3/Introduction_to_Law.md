    - Direct Legislation: Acts of Parliament

    - High Court
    - Court of Appellate
    - Supreme Court

#### 2.2: Civil Courts 

- First instance courts:
    - County Courts
    - Magistrates'courts 
    - High courts 

- Appellate courts:
    - Court of Appeal 
    - Supreme Court 

### 3: Law of binding precedent 

- The common law relies on the doctrine of precedent.

- The decisions of higher courts *bind* lower courts.

- **Supreme Court** binds all others, except its previous decisions.

- **Court of Appeal** only binds all other lower courts, **mostly** bound by itself (previous decisions).

- **High Court** is bound by SC and CA, except by its own previous decisions.

- **Civil** and **Criminal** of CA do not bind each other.


### 4: Statutory Interpretation 

- In order to apply the law Judges often have to interpret the statute that has been made by Parliament.

- There may be ambiguity or dual meaning or an interpretation that wasn't what was envisaged when the Statute was created.

- Could be **Intrinsic aids** and **External aids**.

- Interpretation follows the rules below:
    - THE CONTEXTUAL APPROACH: Interpretation needs to consider the context of the statute and the surrounding and connected text and words.
    - THE ‘LITERAL’ RULE: Where the courts take the words at their face value where there is no ambiguity and their meaning is clear even if this produces an absurd result.
    - THE ‘GOLDEN’ RULE: If there is ambiguity the court will apply the least ridiculous meaning to avoid an absurd result.
    - THE ‘MISCHIEF’ RULE: Allows court to fulfil the statute's intended.



### 5: Laws from European Union: Impact from Brexit

- UK left EU on 31 Jan 2020, the transition period ended 31 Dec 2020.

- Some of EU laws still exist:
    - Domestic Law which implemented or related to former EU obligations. e.g. the UK’s Working Time Regulations which implemented the EU Working Time Directive.

    - EU legislation which was directly applicable in the UK without implementing legislation. e.g. EU General Data Protection Regulation.

    - Other rights and principles in the EU that had direct effect in the UK. e.g. the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality.
