# C Programming Basic 
## I: C Programming Basics and Input and Output
### 1: Input
#### 1.1: Scanf
```cpp
scanf("%s",&name);//%s for string
scanf("%d",&number);//%d for intrigue
scanf("%c",&character);//%c for characters
scanf("%f",&floatnumber);//%f for floatnumbers
scanf("%i",&signedDecimalInt);//%i for signed decimal intrigue
scanf("%o",&unsignedOctalInt);//%o for signed octal int
scanf("%x",&unsignedHexdecinmal);// X for upper hexadecimal,x for lower hex
scanf("%a %b",&a,&b);//input two numbers
scanf("%4d",a);// right specifying the result up to 4 digit (all the result to the right side)
scanf("%.4d",a);// if a = 123 , the result will be 0123
scanf("%.4f",a);// if a = 123.45678, the result will be 123.4568
scanf("%4.4f",a);// The combination of above
scanf("%*.*f",4,4,a);// Same as the last line

// Using the scan set in scanf can terminated the input at specified character
scanf("%8[aeiou]", z); // The string input will be stopped if the letter is not one of 'aeiou'
scanf("%8[^aeiou]", z); // inverted scan set

// It is available to skip certain characters in the input stream:

scanf("%d-%d-%d", &month, &day, &year);
// For the input 02-22-2003, the '-' will be discorded
scanf("%d%*c%d%*c%d", &month, &day, &year);
//For the 02/22/2003, use '* can ensure the input cannot be stored will be discorded.

```

* Note that scanf cannot recognize the "space".

#### 1.2: fgets()
```cpp
fgets(name,sizeof(name),stdin);
```

* fgets() can be use to input the string.
* Notes that it can accept the "space", but there will be an additional "return" in the end.
* A pointer can be use to delete the final "return":

```cpp
char *find;//a pointer of the string
fgets(name,sizeof(name),stdin);
find = strchr(name,'\n');//a function in string.h which can be used to return the address of the first place of '\n'
*find = '\0';
```
### 2: Output

#### 2.1: Common use of printf()

```cpp
// Print the intrigue
printf("%d",&a);// output intrigue
printf("%d %d",&a,&b);//output with space between them
// Print the float number
printf("%e",123.456);// The result will be 1.23456e+002
printf("%f",123.456);//Print 123.456000, six digits in the right side of point
// Print the String and characters
printf("%s\n","hello world");//The conversion specifier 's' will terminated at '\0'.
printf("%p\n",ptr);// The '\p' can be used to print the address of a pointer points to.
```

#### 2.2: Using Flags in the printf format control string

```cpp
printf("%10s%10d%10c%10f\n\n", "hello", 7, 'a', 1.23);
// Using the right justifying 
printf("%-10s%-10d%-10c%-10f\n", "hello", 7, 'a', 1.23);
// Add a '-' can make it to left justifying
printf("%+d\n%+d\n", 786, -786);
// Add '+' to the positive number in the result 
printf("% d\n% d\n", 547, -547);
// Add' ' to the result 
printf("%#o\n", c);
// Add prefix 0 to the octal value
printf("%#x\n", c);
// Add prefix 0x to the hexadecimal numbers
printf("%09d\n", 452);
// Add prefix '0' to the numbers


```

### 3: Reorient the input/output

#### 3.1: Use 'fopen'
```cpp
FILE *f = fopen("PATH","r")// The file path and "r" means read only
fgets(string,length,f);
fscanf(f,"%d",&x);
//same for fprintf()
fclose(f);

```

#### 3.2: Use 'freopen'

```cpp
freopen("PATH","r",stdin);//use the standard input 
freopen("PATH","w",stdout);
fclose(stdin);
fclose(stdout);
```


## II: Data Types
### 1: Introduction
![](image/2022-04-02-22-17-15.png)
### 2: Variables
* Variables are names used to refer a **location in memory** that holds a value.
* Formally, a variable is a symbol or name associated with a fixed **physical address (L- VALUE)**, which denotes a value **(R-VALUE)**.
#### 2.1: Type: Int
* The int type differs from the intrigues in maths.
* It can be short int (16 bits) or long int (32 bits).
* The highest bit used to save the sign. (minus or plus)
* Note that the result of '/' between int will also be an int.
* Note that 'a=++i' means 'a=(++i)' while 'a=i++' means '(a=i)++'.
#### 2.2: Type: Float and double
* Float: Single precision, 32-bits
* Double: Double precision, 64-bits
* Note that the result of '/' between float and double will be float and double.
#### 2.3: Type: Char
* In the C language (unlike other languages) the type char does not denote a new data type, but it is equivalent to the domain of values represented in one byte (range 0-255);
* The integer value is the numeric value of the character in the code ASCII.
#### 2.4: Type: Boolean
* In C programming value 0 means FALSE and Non-zero means TRUTH.
```cpp
x||y;// or
x&&y;// and
!x;// not
```
#### 2.5: Type: String (=character arrays)
* Strings (chunks of text) are represented through an array of chars - structured pre-
defined data type.
* The first place of the array is '0' instead of '1'.
```cpp
char s[10];//10 is the length of the string, s is the pointer to the beginning of the array
char a[]="hello_";
a[5]='\0';// the '\0' means the end of the string
printf("%s",a);// the output will be 'Hello' cause it ended in advance.

```
* Note that compare every letters in a word one by one can be used to do the dictionary order.
```cpp
#include<string.h>
strcmp("a","b");//which can return a number show the '>','<','=' relation
```
#### 2.6: Symbolic names and Constant
```cpp
#define a 100;//define global constant
constant int N = 10;//define local constant
```
## III: Conditional statement
### 1: If-else statement
```cpp
if (result==0)//only one if to make the condition
{
    printf("Hello World!");
}
----------
if(result==0)//use if-else to express different outputs in different conditions
{
    printf("Yes");
}
else
printf("No");
----------
if(result==0)//nested if-else
{
    printf("Yes");
}
else
{
    if(result==1)
    { 
        printf("No");
    }
    else
    printf("Unknown");
}
```
### 2: Switch statement
* Switch-case statement can be use to do multiple choices.
```cpp
switch(getchar())
{
    case 'Y':printf("Yes\n");break;
    case 'N':printf("No\n");break;
    default: printf("Unknown\n");
}
switch(getchar())
{
    case 'Y'://omit this line will let 'Y' and 'y' be same.
    case 'y':printf("Yes\n");break;
    default: printf("No\n");
}
```
## IV: Loop
### 1: while Loop
```cpp
while(scanf("%d",&a)==1)//add the inputs continually
{
    sum+ = a;//save the sum
    if(a<0){
        break;// Terminate the loop when a<0
    }
    if(a=0){
        continue;//skip this loop can continue to next
    }
    count++;//save the counts of the numbers
}
printf("%d",sum);
----------------------
do
{
    sum+ = a;//save the sum
    if(a<0){
        break;// Terminate the loop when a<0
    }
    if(a=0){
        continue;//skip this loop can continue to next
    }
    count++;//save the counts of the numbers
} 
while(count<10);//the loop can only do 10 times
```
### 2: For Loops
```cpp
for(i = 0; i < count; i++)//initial,condition and increments
{
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    sum += a; 
}
```
## Vï¼šFunctions
### 1: Define a function
```cpp
void example(char str[])//non-return function
{
//the main part
}
int sum(int x,int y){//type,name,parameters
    return a+b;//the return value
}
```
### 2: Standard Library Function
#### 2.1: ctype.h
```cpp
isdigit();//check if is a decimal digit
isalpha();//check if is a letter
isupper();//check if is a uppercase letter
islower();//check if is a lowercase letter
isspace();//check if a character is white-space (space, tab, newline, etc.)
ispunct();//check if a character is a punctuation character.
tolower();//convert a letter to lowercase
toupper();//convert a letter to uppercase
iscrtrl();//check if it is control character
ispunct();//check if it is a printing character rather than space, digit or a letter
isprint();//check if it is the character visitable on screen
```
#### 2.2: string.h
```cpp
strlen();//return the length of string
strcmp();//compare the two strings
strstr("hello","ello");//return the position where the second string in the first one
strcpy(first,second,n);// same as "first" = "second" (n is the byte number)
sizeof(); //return the length of string or array, for the pointer will return '8' in Mac (windows/linux '4')
strtod();//convert string to double
strtol();//convert string to long
stroul();//convert the string to unsigned long and its second parameter (pointer) return the part cannot be converted
fgets();//read the line of the text
puts();//print the string with a '\n'
strcat(first.second);//append the second one at the end of the first one
strchr(*s1,c);//Located the first occurrence of c in the first string and returned a pointer to c
strcspn();//Return the length of string 1 containing no characters from string 2
strpbrk();//Search the first string argument for the first occurrence of any character in its second string argument.
strrchr();// Search the last occurrence of the specified character in a string.
strspn();// determine the length of initial part of the string in its first string taht contain only characters from second arguments
strtok(string," ");//used to separate the sentence into words (tokens).

// Below is memory operation functions

memcpy();//copy a specified number of bytes from second pointer into the first pointer.
memove();//like memcpy, but allows bytes from one part of a string to be copied into another part of the same string even if overlap.
memset(void * string,char 'ch',int n);//copies the value of the byte in its second argument into the first n bytes of the objects,can be used to initialize the array with '0' more efficiently



```

#### 2.3: math.h
```cpp
sqrt();
pow();
sin();
log();
fabs();
ceil();//round up to the closest int
floor();//round down to the closest
```
#### 2.4: Recursive function
* Function in C allowed to all themselves which is known as recursion.
```cpp
int numberOfDigits(int x)
{
 // Base case
if (x < 10) return 1;
     // Recursive case
    return numberOfDigits(x / 10) + 1;
}
```
## VI: Arrays and application
### 1: Array
```cpp
char a[3];//a[1],a[1],a[2], note that the index from '0'
int a[2][2];//two-dimension array
printf("%d",a[1][1]);//output as a variable
int c[2]={1,2};//initial directly
int a[2]={1};//is equal to {1,0}
int c[]={1,2};//the initialism will define its size
// The address of two-dimension array a[M][N] can be expressed as a[i] = a[0]+ i x N x sizeof(TYPE)

```
* Use 'size_t' to define the loop variable 'i' which could avoid array overflow. (mostly '%u' or '%lu').

### 2: Linear search
* How to find the position of a given value in an array
```cpp
int linearsearch(const int a[],int size,int value)
{
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
    {
        if(a[i]==value){
            return i;
        }
        else
        return -1;//express the function failed
    }
}
```
### 3: Binary search
* Find the position of the value of a sorted array.
```cpp
int binarySearch(const int a[],int start, int end, int value)
{
if (start > end)//the prerequisite is sorted
{
    return -1;
}
int middle = (start + end) / 2;
if (a[middle] == value)
{
    return middle;
}
if (a[middle] > value)// find the right part
{
    return binarySearch(a, start, middle - 1, value);
}
else
    return binarySearch(a, middle + 1, end, value);//find the left part
}
```
### 4: Sorting

#### 4.1: Swap Sort 
```cpp
void SwapSort(int a[],int size)
{
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++)//sort from the first digit
    {
        int k=i;//use 'k' to save i
        for(int j=i+1;i<size;j++)//check the next digit
        {
            if(a[j]<a[i])
            {
                k=j;
            }
            int tmp=a[i];//tmp to save a[i]
            a[i]=a[k];//swap a[i] and a[j]
            a[k]=tmp;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.2: QuickSort in C

* The prototype of qsort function:

```cpp
void qsort(void *base,int nelem,unsigned int width,int(* pfCompare)(const void *, const void *));
// base: the beginning address of unsorted array
// nelem: the numbers of array
// width: the bit size of each element
// pfCompare: the beginning address of compare function
```

* The rule of compare function:

```cpp
int compare(const void * elem1,const void * elem2);
// If * elem1 should before the elem2, the return value is minus int.
// If * elem1 should after the elem2, the return value should be plus int.
// If each of them in the first is acceptable, the return value is 0.

```

* The example of compare function:

```cpp
int compare(const *void elem1,const void * elem2)
{
    unsigned int * p1, * p2;
    p1 = (unsigned int *) elem1;
    // Note that "*elem1" unavailable
    p2 = (unsigned int *) elem2;
    return (*p1 % 10)-(*p2 % 10);
    // the sorting rule is the first digit 
} 
```



## VII: Files and Pointers
### 1: Files
#### 1.1: Input and Output of files
```cpp
FILE *f = fopen("numbers.txt", "r");//use a pointer to open the file, 'r' for read
fscanf(f, "%d", &a);//fscanf for input
if (f == NULL) //NULL means the file does not exit
{ 
    printf("Error: cannot open file\n"); 
    return 1; 
    }
fclose(f);//fclose for closing the file
FILE *out = fopen("sum.txt" , "w");
//'w' for write
fprintf(out, "%d\n", sum);//fprintf for output
```
#### 1.2: fgets()
```cpp
FILE *f = fopen("modules.txt", "r");
fgets(s, size, f);//note that fgets() will end the input at '\n' and can only read size-1, cause the last digit is '\0'.
while(fgets(s, MAX, f))// fgets() can be used to calculate the line numbers
{
if (strlen(s) == MAX - 1 && s[MAX - 2] != '\n')
{
    printf("Error: buffer overflow\n");
    fclose(f); 
    return 1;
}
    count++; 
}
```
### 2: Pointers
#### 2.1: Operation of Pointers
```cpp
int x=5;
int *p;//define a pointer
p=&x;//a pointer without a '*' can only access an address(with '&')
*p=42;//access the pointer directly
x--;//now the value of x is 41
//note that pointers can only contain same data type!
int *q;
q=p+1;//if the address of p is 100, then q address will be 104(+1 means plus 4 bytes)
```
#### 2.2: Relationship between array and pointers
```cpp
int vet[10];//define an array
printf("%p %p",vet,&vet[0]);//will print two same address
int *pi;
pi=vet;//is equal to 
pi=&vet[0];
*(pi+3)=28;//the fourth of the array is defined as 28
pi++;//change that pi takes the second place of the array
//Note that vet is a constant pointer
int a[]; int *p;
// The name of array 'a' is a constant pointer, which points to a[0], the type of a[] is 'TYPE *'
p=a;// point 'p' to the a[0]
*p=10;// a[0] = 10
*(p+1)=20;// a[1] = 20;


```
#### 2.3: The way using '&' and '*'

The '&' is a binary operator which used to **return the address** of its operand. The * is the *dereference operator*, return  the object to which its operand points to.

For example:

```cpp
int x=5;
int *xPr;
xPr=&x;// The pointer 'xPr' points to address of 'x'
printf("%d",xPr);// Print the value stored in address of xPr (same as 'x')
```

#### 2.4: Using the 'const' qualifier with Pointers 

Use the qualifier 'const' can avoid the parameters being changed when used by pass-by-reference. (The modification of parameters will lead to complier error)

When pass a pointer to a function, the pointer and data can be 'const' or 'non-const', so will provide four situations.

- Non-const Pointer to non-const data:

```cpp
#include<ctype.h>
void convertToUppercase(char *sPtr) 
{
 while (*sPtr != '\0')
    {
    *sPtr = toupper(*sPtr);
    ++sPtr;
    }
}
convertToUppercase(string);
```
When defining a non-const character in function, so we can use toupper() to change what the pointer points to, then use '++' to move the location of the pointer.

- Non-const Pointer to const data: 

```cpp
void printCharacters(const char *sPtr)
 {
    for (; *sPtr != '\0'; ++sPtr) //no initialize
    { 
        printf("%c", *sPtr);
    }
 }
```
In this case, the const pointer 'sPtr' points to cannot be changed, so we can't operate the '*Ptr', but can change the location of 'sPtr' using '++'.

- Const Pointer to non-const data:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
 int x; 
 int y;
 // ptr is a constant pointer to an integer that can be modified
 // through ptr, but ptr always points to the same memory location
 int * const ptr = &x;

 *ptr = 7; // allowed: *ptr is not const
 ptr = &y; // error: ptr is const; cannot assign new address
}
```
The non-const data means the value pointer points to can be changed '*ptr=7', but the location (address) cannot be changed (line 404 will be a complier error).

- Const Pointer to const data:

```cpp
int main(void)
{
 int x = 5; // initialize x
 int y; // define y
 // ptr is a constant pointer to a constant integer. ptr always
 // points to the same location; the integer at that location
 // cannot be modified
 const int *const ptr = &x; // initialization is OK
 printf("%d\n", *ptr);
 *ptr = 7; // error: *ptr is const; cannot assign new value
 ptr = &y; // error: ptr is const; cannot assign new address
 }
 
```

Both the data and pointer are const type, so neither the value nor the location can be changed, or else will produce the error.

#### 2.5: Array of Pointers 

The elements of array can be composed of **pointers** in C, the most common situation is using the **strings of array.** As the type string is actually a pointer points to the beginning of the string. 

For example:

```cpp
const char *suit[4] = {"Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"};
```

In this way, we define the array with four strings as elements.

#### 2.6: Pointers to functions 

We can use pointers that point to a function (actually the beginning address of function),

such as:
```cpp
int (*pf)(int a,char b);
// pf is the name of pointer
```

We can also use the pointers which point to functions in function parameters. (pass-by-reference)

Such as: 

```cpp
void bubble(int work[], size_t size, int (*compare)(int a, int b) );
```
In this example, the pointer 'compare' being used to call another outside function 'compare'.

#### 2.7: Function Pointers in Array 

As the string array we have talked about above, we can also store the pointers to function in array.

```cpp
void (*f[3])(int) ={function1,function2,function3};
```
In this way, an array with three function-pointers is defined. 

#### 2.8: Pointer to a pointer

```cpp
int *p;
int **pp;//define a pointer points to a pointer
p=&n;
pp=*p;// the pp points to *p
printf("%d",*(*pp));// *(*pp) is n
```

#### 2.9: Void Pointer

```cpp
double d = 3.14;
void *p = &d;// void can be initialized or assigned by any type of variables
// Note that for the void * type pointer p, '*p','++p','--p','p-n' have no meaning.


```

## VIII: Structure in C

### 1: Introduction 

* A kind of aggregates of many different type of variables, commonly usd to define the *record* in file.

### 2: Structure Definitions

* This a prototype of structure:

```cpp
struct employee 
// The employee is the structure tag
{
char firstName[20];
char lastName[20]; 
unsigned int age;
char gender;
double hourlySalary;
// All the variables in the braces are the members of the structure, which can be different types
};
```

#### 2.1: Self-referential structures

* The only to reference the structure in itself is using the pointer points to itself:

```cpp
struct employee2 {
char firstName[20];
char lastName[20];
unsigned int age;
char gender;
double hourlySalary;
struct employee2 teamLeader; // ERROR struct employee2 *teamLeaderPtr; // pointer
};
```
#### 2.2: Defining the variables of structures types

* The definition of structures creates a new type that used to define variables of other types:

```cpp
struct card acard, deck[52], *cardPtr;
// aCard is a variable of type struct card
// deck[52] is an array in the struct
// * cardPtr is a pointer in this struct
```

* The another way to define a structure is using comma after the braces:

```cpp
struct card {
    char *face;
    char *suit;
} aCard, deck[52], *cardPtr;

```

#### 2.3: Operations that can be performed on structures

* Assign struct variables to struct variables of the same type.

* Taking the address of a struct variable.

* Accessing the members of a struct members

* Using the sizeof operator.

* NOTE that '==' or '!=' can not be used, cause the size of data of particular type is *machine dependent*.

### 3: Initializing structures

* Structures can be initialized using intializer lists as with array.

```cpp
struct card {
    char *face;
    char *suit;
};
struct card aCard = {"Three","Hearts"};
```
* The other members uninitialized will be set as '0' or 'NULL' for pointers.

### 4: Accessing Structure Members with . and ->

* '.' is called the dot operator which can access member; '->' is called the pointer operator which can access the member by reference.

```cpp
struct card {
    char *face;
    char *suit;
};
int main(void)
{
    struct card aCard;// define a 'card' structure named 'aCard'
    aCard.face = "Ace";
    aCard.suit = "Spades";
    struct card *cardPtr = &aCard;
    // assign address of aCard to a pointer
    printf("%s\n",aCard.face);
    // using '.' print the member
    printf("%s\n",cardPtr->face);
    // using '->' print the member
    printf("%s\n",(*cardPtr).face);
    // using '*' print the member
}
```

### 5: Using Structures with Functions

Structures may be passed to functions by:

* Passing individuals structures members.
* passing an entire structures.
* Passing a pointer to a structure.

### 6: Typeof 

* The keyword *typedef* provides a mechanism for creating alias for previously defined data types.
* Names for structure types are often defined with typeof to create shorter type names.

* For example, the statement:

```cpp
typedef struct card Card;
// defines the new type name Card as a synonym for the type struct card

typedef struct {
    char *face;
    char *suit;
}Card;
// In this way we can create the structure type Card without the need for a separate typedef statement.
```

* After that, 'Card' can now be used to declare variables pf type struct card as:

```cpp
Card deck[52];
```
