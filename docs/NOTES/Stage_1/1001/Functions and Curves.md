# IV Functions and Curves
## 1: Functions- general ideas
### 1.1 What is a function
### 1.2 Combining of functions
### 1.3 Domain and Range
* Domain is all the possible input values.
* Range is all the possible output values.
### 1.4 Inverse Functions
* We use $f^{-1}$ to mean inverse.
* Examples:
  * If $f(x)=1-2x$, we write $f=1-2x$
  * And we can write it as a function of x :$f=1-2x$ 
     $x=\displaystyle\frac{1-f}{2}$
  * $f^{-1}(x)=\displaystyle\frac{1-x}{2}$
  * The graph of the functions and its inverse are reflections of each other in the line $y=x$.
* Domain of $f(x)$ is equal to the Range of $f^{-1}$ and vice versa.
* Other important functions and their inverses:
   * $e^x$ and $\ln{x}$
   * $\sin x$ and $sin^{-1} x$
## 2: Exponential and Logarithmic functions
### 2.1 Exponential function $e^x$ or exp$(x)$ 
#### 2.1.1 The application of $e^x$
* $e^{-x}$-the exponential decay
* $e^{-x^2}$-the normal distribution
* $xe^{-x}$-the Poisson distribution
#### 2.1.2 The hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine
* $\cosh x=\displaystyle\frac{(e^x+e^{-x})}{2}$
* $\sinh x=\displaystyle\frac{(e^x-e^{-x})}{2}$
* Their properties:
   * $(\cosh x)^2-(\sinh x)^2=1$
   * 
    $$
\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\cosh x=\sinh x
    $$
    $$
    \displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\sinh x=\cosh x
    $$
  * $\cosh (ix)= \cos(x)$
  * $\sinh (ix)= i\sin(x)$
### 2.2 Logarithm and powers
## 3: Sine and Cosine functions 
### 3.1 Combination of sine and cosine functions
The combination of the sine and cosine produce more complicated shapes, such as Fourier Series.
## 4: Transformation
### 4.1 Translation and Magnifications
### 4.2 Plotting a quadratic graph
### 4.4 Odd,even and periodic functions
* Even function:$f(-x)=f(-x)$ 
* Odd function:$f(-x)=-f(-x)$
* Periodic function: like $\sin x$
## 5: Curve sketching
### 5.1 Aims and strategy
* Cross or touch the axes.
* Max, min and inflection points
### 5.2 Stationary points- First derivation
Using the first derivation to find the gradient each side.
### 5.3 Stationary points- Secondary derivation
* The inflection points means the $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}\not ={}0$ and $\displaystyle\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=0$.
* The gradient of the function reach a max or min at the infection points.
* It is useful only if the $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}\not ={0}$
## 6: Asymptotes and Rational Functions
### 6.1 Definitions
* The function that is a quotient of two polynomial functions
* As the denominator of the fraction takes the value zero, the function becomes infinite, we get a vertical line called vertical asymptote. The function may have horizontal , sloping and vertical asymptote.
* Theses lines may cross.
### 6.2 Rewriting the functions by long division
 * This is a way to separate the function to make to curves graphing easier.
 * Examples:
   * $\displaystyle\frac{x^2}{x+1}=\displaystyle\frac{(x-1)(x+1)+1}{x+1}=x-1+\displaystyle\frac{1}{x+1}$
    $\quad$
   * $\displaystyle\frac{x+1}{x-3}=\displaystyle\frac{(x-3)+5}{x-3}=1+\displaystyle\frac{5}{x-3}$
  ## 7: Curve Sketching Examples
  ### Example 1
  $$
  y=\displaystyle\frac{2x+1}{(x-1)(x+2)}
  $$
  * Finding the roots of the denominator, which is the vertical asymptotes.
  * Finding the monotony of each parts of the function.
  * Finding the infinite of the function.
### Example 2
$$
y=\displaystyle\frac{x^3-2x^2+x-2}{1-x^2}
$$
* Separating the factors as $(x-2)(x^2+1)$.
* Following the example 1 to get the vertical asymptotes and the monopoly.
* Using the long division to separate the constant to find the slope asymptotes:
$$
y=\displaystyle\frac{(1-x^2)(2-x)}{1-x^2}
$$
i.e.:
$$
y=-x+2+\displaystyle\frac{2x-4}{1-x^2}
$$
As the last part of the term is really small, the slope asymptote is the $y=-x+2$.
### Example 4 (modulus function)
* $y=|x+3|+|x-1|$
* The graph can be drawn by apart the functions.
